"""
This original game has several problems:
1. the input must be captialized, otherwise will cause a trackback
2. the game won't stop until 9 blanks are filled, even one player wins,
the game won't stop

change:
1. add upper() to cast the input into upper cause
2. define a is_win function to test if someone has won. If so, end the
game.
3. add the input done to terminate the game
